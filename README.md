# AG-News

Classification of AG News dataset into business, sports, science/tech and world news using simple RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs. Train set of 114,000 articles, validation set of 6,000 articles and test set of 7,600 articles. I used both word-embeddigns and a one-hot encoder for the tokenization of words. I was able to achieve 86% test accuracy on test set.
